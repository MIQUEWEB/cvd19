      <h1>Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine: What to know</h1>
    
      <p>  <br>SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world.</p>
      <p>Millions of people have contracted the virus, and it has contributed to nearly 2 million deaths.

Researchers have been working around the clock to develop effective vaccines, which people started receiving in December 2020.

This article looks at the types of COVID-19 vaccine, how they work, their safety, and how to get one.</p>

          <p>Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <br>
            <p>• COVID-19 vaccines that are granted with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considered safe and effective based on the available evidence to date.
            	<br>

• Vaccines are some of the most rigorously tested medical products today, and the COVID-19 vaccines are no different. The fact that the COVID-19 vaccines are available for use less than a year since the virus was discovered was not because corners were cut in the conduct of the clinical trials.
<br>
• COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19.
<br>
• With BIDA (Bawal walang mask, I-sanitize ang mga kamay, Dumistansya ng isang metrong layo, Alamin ang tamang impormasyon) steps and adherence to the minimum public health standards, vaccination is an important way to protect yourself from getting severe COVID-19.</p>

        <h2>How Vaccines Work</h2>
        
          <p>• Vaccines mimic the virus or bacteria that causes disease and triggers the body’s creation of antibodies.<br>
           These antibodies will provide protection once a person is infected with the actual disease-causing virus or bacteria.
<br>
• Vaccines differ in their composition and how they trigger the immune response to create antibodies. These antibodies protect the body from microorganisms and serve as protection once a person gets infected with disease. Vaccines can be inactivated, weakened or killed copies of the whole or part of the virus or bacteria, or genetic product (like mRNA vaccines) that creates protein copies without causing disease. </p>
